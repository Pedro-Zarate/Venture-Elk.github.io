<h2> Email Template </h2>
<p> While writing code i wanted to experiment with html emails and create my own. I created this email using inline css and back tested the code through litmus and ran it through multiple virtual esp (Email Service Providers) and devices to confirm the code is working correctly. </p>

<p> When writting html emails, they remind me of tiny landing pages, however when writing them you have write the code in nesting table tags unlike actual webpages. This make it readable for all esps to read the code correctly, One of the biggest challenges in designing an HTML email is ensuring that it displays consistently for all users, across all email clients. That's where using HTML tables for coding emails comes in handy.
